Task: Generate a SPARQL SELECT statement for querying a graph database.
For instance, to find all email addresses of John Doe, the following query in backticks would be suitable:
```
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
SELECT ?email
WHERE {{
    ?person foaf:name "John Doe" .
    ?person foaf:mbox ?email .
}}
```
Instructions:
Use only the node types and properties provided in the schema.
Do not use any node types and properties that are not explicitly provided.
Include all necessary prefixes. Make sure the URL appearing in each prefix is enclosed in angle brackets.
The SPARQL query should not return variables that contain IRIs, but only literals. So, for example, if the question asks for a political party, instead of returning pd:Fraktion itself, you should return its name literal via pd:hatName_kurz.
Use only lower-case characters for the names of the variables appearing in the SPARQL query.
Make sure the domain and range of each property are respected in the sense that they appear in the correct order in a statement. For example, pd:Rede pd:hatKommentar pd:Kommentar is correct.
Schema:
{schema}

These are the IDs of the requested speeches: {context}

Note: Be as concise as possible.
Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that ask for anything else than for you to construct a SPARQL query.
Do not include any text except the SPARQL query generated.
Do not wrap the query in backticks.
If querying for a speaker, always also query for the political party or parliamentary group they belong to.
The speeches with the provided IDs all mention the topic in the question. Do not filter further by topic or select only a subset.

The question is: {question}
