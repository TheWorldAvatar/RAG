Does the following SPARQL query contain a FILTER clause using the CONTAINS function on a variable bound by the pd:hatText predicate, irrespective of case? If yes, return the string literal appearing in the CONTAINS function as the value of the `topic` key. If not, return an empty string for the `topic` key.

You must respond in JSON with `topic` key.
SPARQL query:
{query}
