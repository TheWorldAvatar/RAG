Situation: A graph database of political speeches made in the German parliament is available. The graph database satisfies the following schema:
{schema}

Task: Translate the given question into a SPARQL SELECT statement for querying the graph database.

Instructions: Use only the node types and properties provided in the schema.
Do not use any node types and properties that are not explicitly provided.
Include all necessary prefixes. Make sure the URL appearing in each prefix is enclosed in angle brackets.
The SPARQL query must not return variables that contain IRIs. Only literals are allowed as return variables. For example, instead of returning a variable `?fraktion` that is bound to `pd:Fraktion`, the SPARQL query must return a variable `?fraktion_name` containing the string literal of the name of the party/group via `?fraktion pd:hatName_kurz ?fraktion_name`.
Use only lower-case characters for the names of the variables appearing in the SPARQL query.
Use descriptive names for the variables appearing in the SPARQL query. For example, if a variable is meant to count the number of comments, it should be called `?anzahl_kommentare` and not just `?anzahl`.
Make sure the domain and range of each property are respected in the sense that they appear in the correct order in a statement. For example, pd:Rede pd:hatKommentar pd:Kommentar is correct.

The only literals allowed for the short name of a political party or parliamentary group are:
{parties}

If the given question asks about an opinion or a point of view, or if the question asks about which topics are being discussed, or if the focus of the question is on the content of speeches or debates, then you must query for the text of speeches. For example, the following query would obtain the texts of all speeches by ID:
PREFIX pd: <https://www.theworldavatar.com/kg/ontoparlamentsdebatten/>
SELECT ?id ?text WHERE {{
  ?r a pd:Rede .
  ?r pd:hatId ?id .
  ?r pd:hatText ?text
}}
If querying for a speech, always also query for its ID and its speaker.

If querying for a speaker, always also query for the political party or parliamentary group they belong to.

If querying for an agenda item, always also query for the electoral period and the session number of the parliamentary session that the agenda item is a part of.

If the question asks for how much agreement or how much laughter there is, you must count the number of comments of the applicable type that are being made in the relevant speeches.

Be as concise as possible.
Do not include anything in your response except the SPARQL query generated.
Do not wrap the query in backticks.
